# List of notable changes made between 2.x and 3.0

All breaking changes must be described here. When adding a new entry,
always describe the impact on users and instructions for upgrading
applications from 2.x to 3.0.

See also https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/blob/master/3.0-DEVELOPING.md


## Invocation for remote method has been changed.

We are deprecating the `SharedClass.prototype.find` and
`SharedClass.prototype.disableMethod` for looking up and disabling remote
methods in 3.0. They will be replaced by `SharedClass.prototype.findMethodByName`
and `SharedClass.prototype.disableMethodByName` where you can pass in a static
method or a prototype method name. These new methods will accept a string in the
form of "name" for a static method and "prototype.name" for a prototype method.

To find a static remote method:
`findMethodByName('create')`

To find a prototype remote method:
`findMethodByName('prototype.updateAttributes')`

To disable a static remote method
`disableMethodByName('create')`

To disable a prototype remote method:
`disableMethodByName('prototype.updateAttributes')`

## New error-handler for rest-adapter

The REST adapter (typically created via `loopback.rest()`) uses a new error
handler implementation that provides more secure configuration out of the box.

The `error.status` has been removed and will be replaced by `error.statusCode`,
`statusCode` is more descriptive and avoids ambiguity, users relying on `status`
will need to change implementation accordingly.

To replicate old behavior user can specify `config.local.js` as follow:
```js
module.exports = {
  remoting : {
    errorHandler: {
      handler : function(err, req, res, defaultHandler) {
        err.status = err.statusCode;
        defaultHandler();
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The environment setting `NODE_ENV='production'` is no longer supported,
production vs. debug mode is controlled exclusively by configuration.
Production environment is assumed by default, the insecure debug mode
must be explicitely turned on.

You can learn more about the rationale behind the new handler in
[this comment](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/issues/1650#issuecomment-161920555)

User can specific options in their applications in `config.json` as follow:
```json
{
  "restApiRoot": "/api",
  "host": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 3000,
  "remoting": {
    "errorHandler": {
      "debug": false,
      "log": false
    }
  }
}
```

#### Production mode

Stack trace is never returned in HTTP responses.

Bad Request errors (4xx) provide the following properties copied from the
error object: `name`, `message`, `statusCode` and `details`.

All other errors (including non-Error values like strings or arrays) provide
only basic information: `statusCode` and `message` set to status name from HTTP
specification.

#### Debug mode

When in debug mode, HTTP responses include all properties provided by the error.

For errors that are not an object, their string value is returned in
`message` field.

When a method fails with an array of errors (e.g. bulk create), HTTP the response
contains still a single wrapper error with `details` set to the original array
of errors.

An example of an error response when an array of errors was raised:

```js
{
  error: {
    statusCode: 500,
    name: 'ArrayOfErrors',
    message: 'Failed with multiple errors, see `details` for more information.',
    details: [
      { name: 'Error1', message: 'expected error', statusCode: 500, stack: '<stacktrace>' },
      { name: 'Error2', message: 'expected error2', statusCode: 500, stack: '<stacktrace>'}
    ]
  }
}
```

Please see [Related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-remoting/pull/302) here, and new [`strong-error-handler` here](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-error-handler/).

## Type converters replace `Dynamic` API

The `Dynamic` component was removed in favour of type converters and a
registry.

The following APIs were removed:

```js
RemoteObjects.convert(name, fn)
remoteObjectsInstance.convert(name, fn)
RemoteObjects.defineType(name, fn)
remoteObjectsInstance.defineType(name, fn)
```

Two new APIs are added as a replacement:

```js
remoteObjectsInstance.defineType(name, converter)
remoteObjectsInstance.defineObjectType(name, factoryFn)
```

See the API docs and
[pull request #343](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-remoting/pull/343)
for more details.

## Conversion and coercion of input arguments

We have significantly reworked conversion and coercion of input arguments
when using the default REST adapter.  The general approach is to make both
conversion and coercion more strict. When we are not sure how to treat
an input value, we rather return HTTP error `400 Bad Request` than coerce
the value incorrectly.

Most notable breaking changes:

 - `null` value is accepted only for "object", "array" and "any"
 - Empty string is coerced to undefined to support ES6 default arguments
 - JSON requests providing scalar values for array-typed argument are
   rejected
 - Empty value is not converted to an empty array
 - Array values containing items of wrong type are rejected. For
   example, an array containing a string value is rejected when
   the input argument expects an array of numbers.
 - Array items from JSON requests are not coerced. For example,
   `[true]` is no longer coerced to `[1]` for number arrays,
   and the request is subsequently rejected.
 - Deep members of object arguments are no longer coerced. For example,
   a query like `?arg[count]=42` produces `{ count: '42' }` now.
 - "any" coercion preserves too large numbers as a string, to prevent
   losing precision.
 - Boolean types accepts only four string values:
    'true', 'false', '0' and '1'
   Values are case-insensitive, i.e. 'TRUE' and 'FaLsE' work too.
 - Date type detects "Invalid Date" and rejects such requests.
 - When converting a value coming from a string source like querystring
   to a date, and the value is a timestamp (i.e. an integer), we treat
   the value as a number now. That way the value "0" always produces
   "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" instead of some date around 1999/2000/2001
   depending on server timezone.
 - Array values are not allowed for arguments of type object.

Hopefully this change should leave most LoopBack applications (and clients)
unaffected. If your start seeing unusual amount of 400 error responses after
upgrading to LoopBack 3.x, then please check the client code and ensure it
correctly encodes request parameters.

 - [#349](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-remoting/pull/349)

## Serialization of Date values in responses

The format of date values has been changed from the output of `.toString()`,
which produces values in local timezone, to the output of `.toJSON()`, which
produces values in GMT.

For example, let's take `new Date(0)` returned for `dateArgument`.

In strong-remoting 2.x, this value is converted to the following response
when running on a computer in the Central-European timezone:

```json
{
  "dateArgument": {
    "$type": "date",
    "$data": "Thu Jan 01 1970 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (CET)"
  }
}
```

In strong-remoting 3.x, the same value is converted to the following response
regardless of the server timezone settings:

```json
{
  "dateArgument": {
    "$type": "date",
    "$data": "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## CORS is no longer enabled

There are two types of applications that are commonly built using LoopBack,
and each type has different requirements when it comes to CORS.

 1. Public facing API servers serving a variety of clients.
  CORS should be enabled to allow 3rd party sites to access the API server
  living on a different domain.

 2. API+SPA sites where both API and the SPA client live on the same domain
  and the API should be locked down to serve only its own browser clients,
  i.e. CORS must be disabled.

By enabling CORS by default, we were making API+SPA sites vulnerable by default.

In strong-remoting 3.x, we removed the built-in CORS middleware and pushed
the responsibility for enabling and configuring CORS back to application
developers.

Note that this does not affect LoopBack applications scaffolded by a recent
version of `slc loopback` or `apic loopback`, as these applications don't rely
on the built-in CORS middleware and configure CORS explicitly
in `server/middleware.json`.

If your application relies on the built-in CORS middleware that used to be
provided by strong-remoting/loopback, then please make the following changes
to upgrade your application:

1) `npm install --save cors`

2a) If you are using loopback-boot, then add the following entry to your
`server/middleware.json` file:

```js
{
  // ...
  "initial": {
    // ...
    "cors": {
      "params": {
        "origin": true,
        "credentials": true,
        "maxAge": 86400
      }
    },
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

2b) If you are not using loopback-boot, then configure the `cors` middleware
in your server script:

```js
// ...

var cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors({ origin: true, credentials: true, maxAge: 86400 }));

// ...
```

It's important to add the `cors` middleware early, before any request-parsing
middleware.
